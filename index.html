      <h2>Why One Line Weather exists</h2>
      <p>One Line Weather was born from a simple idea: most people don't need endless weather data, charts or interactive maps — they just want to know what to expect today. The app answers that question in a clear, honest sentence. No login, no ads, no distractions. Just the weather, simplified.</p>

      <p>Weather apps often try to show everything at once — humidity levels, wind patterns, radar animations, UV index, moon phases and more. But in daily life, that’s not always useful. For most situations, all you really want to know is: what does it feel like outside, and how does that compare to yesterday?</p>

      <h2>The core idea: weather in a single sentence</h2>
      <p>That one sentence is the heart of One Line Weather. It gives you the current temperature, the dominant weather condition, and a short comparison to the previous day. This simple combination helps you quickly understand what’s going on without needing to interpret graphs or symbols.</p>

      <p>Instead of forcing users to think in absolute numbers, this app offers context. If it’s 17°C and cloudy, that means something different depending on whether it was 25°C or 12°C the day before. By highlighting the difference, the forecast becomes immediately relatable. It’s not just data — it’s orientation.</p>

      <h2>Clarity through reduction</h2>
      <p>One Line Weather was intentionally designed without visual noise. There are no animations, pop-ups or background layers. The typography is clean, the layout is simple, and the icons are purely functional. This reduces the time it takes to understand the forecast — and respects your attention.</p>

      <p>Whether you're checking the weather before leaving home, during your commute or while working, One Line Weather gives you what you need and gets out of your way. It’s ideal for people who value minimalism, quiet design and functional tools.</p>

      <h2>Forecast for the whole day, reduced to the essentials</h2>
      <p>Below the main sentence, One Line Weather displays a structured view of the day. Morning, noon, evening and night are each shown with three key pieces of information: the average temperature, a weather icon and the probability of rain. These four snapshots help you plan your day without overload.</p>

      <p>Instead of raw hourly data, the app groups weather periods into useful time blocks. This makes it easier to glance at the forecast and immediately spot when it might be cooler, wetter or clearer. You don’t need to interpret changing conditions hour by hour — the app does that work for you, and gives you only what matters.</p>

      <h2>Built for calm and speed</h2>
      <p>One Line Weather loads instantly, works on any modern browser and requires no setup. You don’t have to accept cookies, create an account or configure a location. Just type your city, and you’ll see the current weather — in plain language.</p>

      <p>This approach makes the app especially useful for quick checks throughout the day. It also works well on low-power devices and minimal setups like monochrome displays or focused browser start pages. Wherever you open it, One Line Weather stays silent, fast and focused.</p>

      <h2>Less noise. More relevance.</h2>
      <p>One Line Weather isn’t trying to compete with large forecast platforms. It’s not a tool for deep analysis or meteorological planning. It’s a quiet, focused utility for everyday use — a way to check the weather quickly and move on. If you believe that simplicity is powerful, this app was made for you.</p>
