    <h1>About One Line Weather</h1>

    <p>One Line Weather is more than just another weather app. It is a tool designed for simplicity, clarity and speed — built for those who value information without distraction. In a world full of overloaded interfaces, cookie banners and constant tracking, One Line Weather focuses on the essential: giving you a reliable summary of the current weather in a single, clear sentence.</p>

    <p>This app provides instant weather information at a glance. As soon as you open the page, you get a short sentence showing the temperature, the dominant condition and a comparison to yesterday. It’s fast, unobtrusive and ready for everyday use — whether you're heading out the door, on the train, or glancing at your E-Ink display.</p>

    <p>Below the main summary, you’ll find detailed information split into four parts of the day: morning, noon, evening and night. Each time range includes an average temperature and the probability of rain. All data is pulled live from reliable and openly accessible sources, ensuring accuracy and global coverage.</p>

    <p>One Line Weather collects no personal data, uses no cookies and has no tracking scripts. Geolocation is handled only to determine the weather at your requested location, without saving or sharing that information. This app is built with open, privacy-respecting technologies including OpenStreetMap for geolocation and Open-Meteo for real-time weather data.</p>

    <p>The design philosophy behind One Line Weather is minimalism — not only in appearance, but also in how it works. It's optimized for fast loading times and runs smoothly even on low-power devices. Whether you use a smartphone, tablet, desktop or a TRMNL-like E-Ink interface, the experience remains consistent and efficient.</p>

    <p>The app is ideal for users who are tired of bloated weather apps. It appeals to digital minimalists, privacy-conscious individuals, developers, and anyone who simply wants to know what the weather is like — without the noise. The clean interface and typographic clarity also make it useful for public screens or business dashboards.</p>

    <p>One Line Weather continues to evolve. Features such as TRMNL integration, offline-capable AI-generated weather sentences using local models like transformers.js, and weekly trend analysis are in the works. But the mission stays the same: delivering weather information in a way that’s useful, clear and respectful of your attention and privacy.</p>

    <p>Whether you're a designer, scout, remote worker, tech enthusiast or simply someone who prefers clarity over clutter — One Line Weather is made for you.</p>
