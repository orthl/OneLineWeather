    <h1>About One Line Weather</h1>

    <p><strong>One Line Weather</strong> is a simple and focused weather app that shows the current conditions in one sentence — no ads, no tracking, no distractions. Designed for speed and clarity, it's the perfect tool for those who just want to know what the weather is like, instantly.</p>

    <h2>Why One Line Weather?</h2>
    <p>While most weather apps overwhelm users with data, images, and trackers, One Line Weather does the opposite. It’s fast, clean, and entirely focused on the essentials: current temperature, condition, and a daily comparison to yesterday — all displayed in a clear, readable sentence.</p>

    <p>Below the summary, you’ll find a visual forecast for morning, noon, evening, and night, including average temperature and rain probability per period.</p>

    <h2>Privacy First</h2>
    <p>One Line Weather collects no personal data. No cookies, no analytics, no third-party tracking. All geolocation data is handled locally, using only public, privacy-respecting APIs like OpenStreetMap’s Nominatim and Open-Meteo.</p>

    <h2>Made for Simplicity</h2>
    <p>This app is ideal for anyone who prefers reduced digital interfaces — from mobile minimalists to E-Ink display users and TRMNL fans. It’s fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and low-power devices.</p>

    <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>🌍 Geolocation via <a href="https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank">OpenStreetMap Nominatim</a></li>
      <li>🌤 Weather data from <a href="https://open-meteo.com/" target="_blank">Open-Meteo</a></li>
      <li>🖼️ Icons by <a href="https://bas.dev/" target="_blank">Meteocons by Bas</a></li>
      <li>🔤 Font: <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode" target="_blank">FiraCode</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Roadmap</h2>
    <p>We're working on new features like TRMNL integration, local AI-generated weather sentences (on-device), and weekly trends. The goal remains the same: clarity and control.</p>

    <h2>Who is this for?</h2>
    <p>Whether you’re a developer, designer, digital minimalist, or just want the weather without the noise — One Line Weather is made for you.</p>
