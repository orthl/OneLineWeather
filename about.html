  <h1>About One Line Weather</h1>

  <h2>Weather Information, Simplified</h2>
  <p>One Line Weather is more than just another weather app. It’s a tool designed for simplicity, clarity, and speed — built for people who value quick and distraction-free access to weather data. In a world of overloaded apps, cookie banners and excessive tracking, One Line Weather delivers exactly what you need: the current weather in a single, easy-to-read sentence.</p>

  <h2>Fast, Clean and Minimalist Forecasts</h2>
  <p>The app provides instant weather summaries. As soon as you open the page, you’ll see the current temperature, the dominant condition, and a comparison to yesterday — all in one concise sentence. This makes it perfect for a quick glance in the morning, on the go, or on minimalist displays like TRMNL or E-Ink devices.</p>

  <h2>Detailed Daily Outlooks</h2>
  <p>Beneath the main sentence, the app shows weather details for morning, noon, evening, and night — including average temperatures and rain probabilities. All data comes from trusted, publicly available sources to ensure global accuracy and transparency.</p>

  <h2>Privacy-First Weather App</h2>
  <p>One Line Weather collects no personal data. There are no cookies, no tracking scripts, and no analytics. Your location is processed anonymously for forecast delivery, using open and privacy-respecting technologies such as OpenStreetMap’s Nominatim and Open-Meteo.</p>

  <h2>Open Source and Transparent</h2>
  <p>One Line Weather is fully open source. The project is available for anyone to inspect, adapt, or contribute to. This transparency ensures long-term trust and allows developers to use or host the application independently — whether for personal projects, self-hosted dashboards or lightweight weather displays. Open code, open data, and a commitment to public infrastructure are at the core of the app’s design.</p>

  <h2>Designed for Minimalism and Speed</h2>
  <p>The app’s interface is deliberately reduced to the essentials. It loads fast and runs smoothly, even on older or low-powered hardware. Whether you're using a smartphone, tablet, desktop, or a low-power E-Ink screen, One Line Weather delivers a consistent and clear experience.</p>

  <h2>For Minimalists, Makers and Professionals</h2>
  <p>This app is ideal for anyone tired of bloated weather apps. It appeals to digital minimalists, privacy-conscious users, developers, designers, and professionals who need quick weather insights. The typographic clarity also makes it well-suited for office dashboards or info displays.</p>

  <h2>Future-Ready: Local AI and More</h2>
  <p>One Line Weather is in active development. Features like TRMNL integration, on-device AI-generated weather descriptions using transformers.js, and weekly trend summaries are planned. But the mission will always stay the same: clear, helpful weather data without noise or compromise.</p>
